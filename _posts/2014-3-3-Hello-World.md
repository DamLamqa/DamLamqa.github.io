You know the times when you’re being described a incident happening between someone’s family members, elderly neighbors and visiting cousins? It’s hard to follow, but you still want the drama.

In 2017, we were approached at VDA-lab to work on a visualization that could bring together data collected by researchers in art history, in a way that could help them understand the stories and trajectories of historical persons, and their impact on their community. 


This data is comprised of parish and guild records, essentially combining personal information (birth and death dates, spouses, children as well as godparents) with what can essentially be described as “professional” information: masters, pupils, collaborations and so on. 





The following tool is therefore the output of a few months of collaboration. You can jump to the tool, or read about the process and the data below
