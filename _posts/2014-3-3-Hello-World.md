In 2017, we were approached at VDA-lab to work on a visualization that could bring together data collected by researchers in art history, in a way that could help them understand the stories and trajectories of historical persons, and their impact on their community. 


The data was comprised of parish and guild records, essentially combining personal information (birth and death dates, spouses, children as well as godparents) with what can essentially be described as “professional” information: masters, pupils, collaborations and so on.
