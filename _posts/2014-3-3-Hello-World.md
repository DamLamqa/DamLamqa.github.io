You know the times when you’re being described a incident happening between someone’s family members, elderly neighbors and visiting cousins? It’s hard to follow, but you still want the drama. 
Well I wouldn’t have expected it but it turns out studying records from art history can be a similar experience, where to retrace the influence of specific actors, researchers have to dig into confusing timelines of who married who, who moved where, and who tutored who. In 2017, we were approached at VDA-lab to work on a visualization that could bring together data collected by researchers in art history, in a way that could help them understand the stories and trajectories of historical persons, and their impact on their community. 


This data is comprised of parish and guild records, essentially combining personal information (birth and death dates, spouses, children as well as godparents) with what can essentially be described as “professional” information: masters, pupils, collaborations and so on. 

The goal of the project being enabling the understanding of influence and impact of artists on their community (and vice-versa).



## Tool
Here's a view on the main visualization I designed -- It's live, play on! --

## Data

The data we were handed was a ~~messy~~ complex story of love and drama between three families of artists, tapesty producers and merchants. This story was also declined as a spreadsheet summarizing the family and professional links. 





## Process

Because this started as essentially a side project, the user study was not as rigorous as I would have wanted, but with some effort and extreme helpfulness from everyone involved, we managed to reach a good understanding of how we can help. This study was done through:
