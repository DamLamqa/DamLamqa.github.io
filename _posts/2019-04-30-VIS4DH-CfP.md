title: CfP for VIS4DH 2019 is out
---


This year's [CfP is out for the full day VIS4DH](http://vis4dh.org/) workshop happening during the IEEE VIS conference.
 
We chose to place the workshop on the theme of trust, as it's an issue that arises a lot when working in collaboration between tech researchers and humanities scholars.
 
My [position paper published last year in the same workshop](https://projectcornelia.be/download/When%20the%20Tech%20Kids%20are%20Running%20Too%20Fast%20%20Data%20Visualisation%20Through%20the%20Lens%20of%20Art%20History%20Research%20(7).pdf) had been on a similar topic, as we had tried to address how the issue of trust and collaboration can appear between art historians and vis designers. So this year, I'm looking forward to see how this question can appear from the lens of different disciplines.
